### Practical:  Steganography using cmd
### Definition:

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data (like text, files, or images) inside another file — such as an image, audio, or video — so that no one can tell there’s hidden information.
Unlike encryption, which scrambles data, steganography hides its very existence.
